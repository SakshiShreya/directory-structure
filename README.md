# Directory Structure

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**NOTE:** This project does not involve any kind of backend/middleware. Thus, if you try to reload, all data is deleted.

## How to setup

- Clone the app from GitHub
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SakshiShreya/directory-structure.git
  ```

- Install all the dependencies
  
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Start the app

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
